The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teaching to be moved to the online mode. Digital and IT Tools have come to the rescue by supporting the education sector in imparting education. Every coin has two sides:- the pandemic induced frustration has elicited deplorable behviour which affects the students and teachers. Steps need to be taken to curb this menace. The major modus operandi used by miscreants is to use the links from authorized students and enter the meetings and cause havoc. Steps need to be taken to curb this menace. We propose a solution in which: 

- IP addresses of the authorized devices are stored on the centralized database. 
- IP addresses of the users entering the meeting are tracked and compared with the one in the database.
- In case of match, the user is flagged as authorized. 
- In case of mismatch, the user is flagged as unauthorised for the teacher to take action.

Equipped with a profanity filter to prevent offensive words and graphics to be displayed to students and teachers. 
The solution seems to be commercialy viable, since it can be used both as a product and a service. The solution also has a huge market since it involves a previously untapped domain. The solution seems to be practically implementable as well from the current technology and involves browser extensions, a centralized database, an application and a backend to provide the services.
